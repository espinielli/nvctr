#' Find the three angles about new axes in the zyx order from a rotation matrix.
#'
#' The 3 angles z,y,x about new axes (intrinsic) in the order z-y-x are found
#' from the rotation matrix R_AB. The angles (called Euler angles or
#' Taitâ€“Bryan angles) are defined by the following procedure of successive
#' rotations:
#'  Given two arbitrary coordinate frames A and B. Consider a temporary frame
#'  T that initially coincides with A. In order to make T align with B, we
#'  first rotate T an angle z about its z-axis (common axis for both A and T).
#'  Secondly, T is rotated an angle y about the NEW y-axis of T. Finally, T
#'  is rotated an angle x about its NEWEST x-axis. The final orientation of
#'  T now coincides with the orientation of B.
#'
#'  The signs of the angles are given by the directions of the axes and the
#'  right hand rule.
#'
#'  Note that if A is a north-east-down frame and B is a body frame, we
#'  have that z=yaw, y=pitch and x=roll.
#'
#' @param R_AB a 3x3 rotation matrix (direction cosine matrix) such that the
#'             relation between a vector v decomposed in A and B is
#'             given by: v_A = R_AB * v_B
#'
#' @return z,y,x angles of rotation about new axes (rad)
