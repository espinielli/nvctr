Description: The n-vector framework uses the normal vector to the Earth ellipsoid
  (called n-vector) as a non-singular position representation that turns out to
  be very convenient for practical position calculations.
  The n-vector is simple to use and gives exact answers for all global positions,
  and all distances, for both ellipsoidal and spherical Earth models.
