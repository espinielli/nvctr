Description: The n-vector library from FFI, the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment,
  uses the normal vector to the Earth ellipsoid (called n-vector)
  as a non-singular position representation that turns out to be very
  convenient for practical position calculations.
  The n-vector is simple to use and gives exact answers for all global positions,
  and all distances, for both ellipsoidal and spherical Earth models.
